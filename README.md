Wiremit: A Modern Money Transfer Application
Overview
This project is a single-page React application designed to simulate a modern money transfer service. The application, named Wiremit, is built with a focus on a clean, responsive user interface and a clear user experience.

Features
Authentication: Users can sign up, log in, and log out securely. This is handled using Firebase Authentication.

Responsive Navigation: The application includes a responsive navigation bar that transforms into a hamburger menu on smaller screens for a better mobile experience.

Dashboard: A personalized dashboard welcomes the authenticated user. It includes a dynamic carousel for displaying promotional content or advertisements.

Real-time Data: The application is built to handle real-time data flow, with components and state management set up for future integration with a back-end service.

Technology Stack
Frontend:

React.js: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.

React Router: For handling navigation between different pages/components.

CSS: Custom stylesheets (.css files) are used for styling and responsiveness.

Backend (Mock):

Firebase Authentication: Used for user sign-up and login.

Implementing a more robust state management solution (e.g., Redux or Context API) for larger-scale data.

Adding unit and end-to-end tests to ensure code reliability.
